#
# Example config file for ht://Dig.
#
# This configuration file is used by all the programs that make up ht://Dig.
# Please refer to the attribute reference manual for more details on what
# can be put into this file.  (http://www.htdig.org/confindex.html)
# Note that most attributes have very reasonable default values so you
# really only have to add attributes here if you want to change the defaults.
#
# What follows are some of the common attributes you might want to change.
#

#
# Specify where the database files need to go.  Make sure that there is
# plenty of free disk space available for the databases.  They can get
# pretty big.
#
database_dir:		/var/lib/htdig/db

#
# This specifies the URL where the robot (htdig) will start.  You can specify
# multiple URLs here.  Just separate them by some whitespace.
# The example here will cause the ht://Dig homepage and related pages to be
# indexed.
# You could also index all the URLs in a file like so:
# start_url:	       `${common_dir}/start.url`
#
start_url:		http://192.168.192.11/

conf_dir:		/srv/htdocs_not_linked/htdoogle
common_dir:		${conf_dir}

# simple relative path, from which the images could be accessed
# it is the path used from httpd
image_dir:		/htdoogle/
#
# This attribute limits the scope of the indexing process.  The default is to
# set it to the same as the start_url above.  This way only pages that are on
# the sites specified in the start_url attribute will be indexed and it will
# reject any URLs that go outside of those sites.
#
# Keep in mind that the value for this attribute is just a list of string
# patterns. As long as URLs contain at least one of the patterns it will be
# seen as part of the scope of the index.
#
limit_urls_to:		${start_url}

#
# If there are particular pages that you definitely do NOT want to index, you
# can use the exclude_urls attribute.  The value is a list of string patterns.
# If a URL matches any of the patterns, it will NOT be indexed.  This is
# useful to exclude things like virtual web trees or database accesses.  By
# default, all CGI URLs will be excluded.  (Note that the /cgi-bin/ convention
# may not work on your web server.  Check the  path prefix used on your web
# server.)
#
exclude_urls:		/cgi-bin/ .cgi ?

#
# Since ht://Dig does not (and cannot) parse every document type, this
# attribute is a list of strings (extensions) that will be ignored during
# indexing. These are *only* checked at the end of a URL, whereas
# exclude_url patterns are matched anywhere.
#
bad_extensions:		.wav .gz .z .sit .au .zip .tar .hqx .exe .com .gif \
	.jpg .jpeg .aiff .class .map .ram .tgz .bin .rpm .mpg .mov .avi .css

#
# The string htdig will send in every request to identify the robot.  Change
# this to your email address.

#
# The excerpts that are displayed in long results rely on stored information
# in the index databases.  The compiled default only stores 512 characters of
# text from each document (this excludes any HTML markup...)  If you plan on
# using the excerpts you probably want to make this larger.  The only concern
# here is that more disk space is going to be needed to store the additional
# information.  Since disk space is cheap (! :-)) you might want to set this
# to a value so that a large percentage of the documents that you are going
# to be indexing are stored completely in the database.  At SDSU we found
# that by setting this value to about 50k the index would get 97% of all
# documents completely and only 3% was cut off at 50k.  You probably want to
# experiment with this value.
# Note that if you want to set this value low, you probably want to set the
# excerpt_show_top attribute to false so that the top excerpt_length characters
# of the document are always shown.
#
max_head_length:	1000

#
# To limit network connections, ht://Dig will only pull up to a certain limit
# of bytes. This prevents the indexing from dying because the server keeps
# sending information. However, several FAQs happen because people have files
# bigger than the default limit of 100KB. This sets the default a bit higher.
# (see <http://www.htdig.org/FAQ.html> for more)
#
max_doc_size:		20000000

#
# Most people expect some sort of excerpt in results. By default, if the
# search words aren't found in context in the stored excerpt, htsearch shows
# the text defined in the no_excerpt_text attribute:
# (None of the search words were found in the top of this document.)
# This attribute instead will show the top of the excerpt.
#
no_excerpt_show_top:	true

#
# Depending on your needs, you might want to enable some of the fuzzy search
# algorithms.  There are several to choose from and you can use them in any
# combination you feel comfortable with.  Each algorithm will get a weight
# assigned to it so that in combinations of algorithms, certain algorithms get
# preference over others.  Note that the weights only affect the ranking of
# the results, not the actual searching.
# The available algorithms are:
#	accents
#	exact
#	endings
#	metaphone
#	prefix
#	soundex
#	substring
#	synonyms
# By default only the "exact" algorithm is used with weight 1.
# Note that if you are going to use the endings, metaphone, soundex, accents,
# or synonyms algorithms, you will need to run htfuzzy to generate
# the databases they use.
#
search_algorithm:	exact:1
# synonyms:0.5 endings:0.1

#
# The following are the templates used in the builtin search results
# The default is to use compiled versions of these files, which produces
# slightly faster results. However, uncommenting these lines makes it
# very easy to change the format of search results.
# See <http://www.htdig.org/hts_templates.html> for more details.

# The following are used to change the text for the page index.
